# 📚 Bitrix24 Knowledge Hub

## 🎯 Purpose

This file is the **central knowledge hub** for AI agents working on Bitrix24 applications. It contains **language-agnostic guidelines** plus links to specialized documents.

## 🌐 Bitrix24 Application Architecture

The starter provides a Bitrix24 app skeleton that uses a simplified OAuth 2.0 installation flow. Out of the box it registers two widgets: a CRM deal tab and a custom CRM field widget.

### System components

**REST API**

- Single entry point to portal data
- OAuth 2.0 authorization for apps
- Webhook notifications for events
- Batch requests for performance

**Bitrix24 JavaScript SDK**

- Client-side API wrapper
- Portal UI management
- UI event handling

**UI Kit / design system**

- Bitrix24-styled components
- Consistent UX across apps
- Responsive by design

## 📊 Core CRM Entities

- **Leads:** potential customers, first contact, can convert into deals or contacts
- **Deals:** sales opportunities with pipeline stages, linked to contacts/companies
- **Contacts:** individual clients, personal data, interaction history
- **Companies:** corporate clients, linked contacts, organization data
- **Activities:** calls, meetings, tasks, scheduling, CRM analytics

## 🔧 Choosing a Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js:** see [`node/knowledge.md`](node/knowledge.md) (recommended for full-stack JS)

### Frontend

Use the patterns documented in [`frontend/knowledge.md`](frontend/knowledge.md) regardless of backend choice.

## 🛡️ Manual Security Checks

- Run `make security-scan` to execute `scripts/security-scan.sh`.
- The script launches `composer audit --locked --format=json` (PHP backend) and `pnpm audit --prod --json` (Nuxt frontend) inside Docker containers.
- Reports are stored under `reports/security/` for easy sharing (CI, issue trackers, etc.).
- Non-zero exit on vulnerabilities; override via `SECURITY_SCAN_ALLOW_FAILURES=1 make security-scan` or `./scripts/security-scan.sh --allow-fail`.
- The script never runs automatically — developers decide when to audit dependencies.

## 🔄 Workflow for AI Agents

### Step 1 — Understand the problem

1. What’s the primary functionality (CRM/tasks/calendar/reports)?
2. Which data types are involved (leads/deals/contacts/companies)?
3. Which Bitrix24 mechanisms are required (widgets/robots/event handlers)?

### Step 2 — Choose the stack

1. Pick PHP/Python/Node.js based on requirements.
2. Frontend must rely on Bitrix24 UI Kit for consistent UX.

### Step 3 — Read specialized docs

1. Open `[stack]/knowledge.md` for language-specific fundamentals.
2. Dive into subtopics only when needed.
3. Check `bitrix24/` for platform edge cases.

### Step 4 — Implement

1. Follow `[stack]/code-review.md` rules.
2. Respect typing and best practices of the language.
3. Test against the Bitrix24 API.

## ⚠️ Guidelines for AI Agents

### 🎯 Focused learning

- Don’t load every document at once.
- Only read sections relevant to the task.
- Treat this file as a navigation center.

### 🔄 Iterative approach

- Understand architecture first.
- Pick technologies second.
- Study detailed docs third.

### 📖 Keep information fresh

- Verify SDK and API versions.
- Watch for deprecated methods.
- Use modern development practices.
